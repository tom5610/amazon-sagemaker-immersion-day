    "## Sklearn script mode training and serving\n",
    "Script mode is a training script format for a number of supported frameworks that lets you execute the training script in SageMaker with minimal modification. The [SageMaker Python SDK](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk) handles transferring your script to a SageMaker training instance. On the training instance, SageMaker's native SKlearn support sets up training-related environment variables and executes your training script. In this tutorial, we use the SageMaker Python SDK to launch a training job and deploy the trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Script mode supports training with a Python script, a Python module, or a shell script. In this example, we use a Python script to train a classification model on the [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris). In this example, we will show how easily you can train a SageMaker using scikit-learn and with SageMaker Python SDK. In addition, this notebook demonstrates how to perform real time inference with the [SageMaker SKlearn container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/pre-built-docker-containers-scikit-learn-spark.html).
